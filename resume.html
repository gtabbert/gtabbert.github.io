				<h3>Experience</h3>
				<strong>Entrepreneur Photographer — current</strong>
				<p>Photography is a talent and a passion. I have a small following of clients who have utilized my talents, including building sales brochures, engagement photos and senior portraits.
				</p>
				<strong>Career Services Intern - Fall 2013</strong>
				<p>I assisted in the update of a website that students use for career-related resources. I  updated the website to include up-to-date resources that help with resume building,  interviewing, and helping other students decide their major.</p>
				<strong>Asia University America Program, EWU — 2012-2014</strong>
				<p>This was a voluntary position where I helped Japanese Students from Asia University learn English and gain understanding of American Culture. I was also the organization’s resident photographer.
